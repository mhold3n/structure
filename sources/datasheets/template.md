# Source Datasheet: [Source Name]

## 1. Motivation

- **For what purpose was the dataset created?** (e.g., research, education, archival)
- **Who created the dataset?** (e.g., specific organization, person)
- **Who funded the creation of the dataset?**

## 2. Composition

- **What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent?** (e.g., documents, images, code)
- **How many instances are there?**
- **Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample?**
- **Is there a label or target associated with each instance?**
- **Is any information missing from individual instances?**
- **Are there recommended data splits?** (e.g., train/dev/test)

## 3. Collection Process

- **How was the data associated with each instance acquired?**
- **If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy?**
- **Who was involved in the data collection process?**
- **Over what timeframe was the data collected?**

## 4. Preprocessing / Cleaning / Labeling

- **Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done?** (e.g., discretization, tokenization, removal of instances)
- **Was the "raw" data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data?**

## 5. Uses

- **Has the dataset been used for any tasks already?**
- **Is there a repository that links to or papers using the dataset?**
- **What are other tasks for which the dataset could be used?**
- **Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses?**

## 6. Distribution

- **Will the dataset be distributed to third parties outside of the entity (e.g., company, institution, organization) on behalf of which the dataset was created?**
- **How will the dataset will be distributed?**
- **When will the dataset be distributed?**
- **Will the dataset be distributed under a copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)?**

## 7. Maintenance

- **Who is supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset?**
- **How can the owner/curator/manager of the dataset be contacted (e.g., email address)?**
- **Is there an erratum?**
- **Will the dataset be updated?** (e.g., to correct labeling errors, add new instances, delete instances)
